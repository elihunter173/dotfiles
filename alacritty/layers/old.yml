# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  # TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 0
    lines: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 1
    y: 1

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: none

  # When true, alacritty starts maximized.
  start_maximized: false

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  history: 10000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
  # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used
  # to allow mouse scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.
  faux_multiplier: 3

  # Scroll to the bottom when new text is written to the terminal.
  auto_scroll: false

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
tabspaces: 4

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # Normal (roman) font face
  # normal:
    # Font family

    #   - (Linux) monospace
    #   - (Windows) Consolas
    # family: monospace

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Regular

  # Bold font face
  # bold:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the bold family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    # family: monospace

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Bold

  # Italic font face
  # italic:

    # If the italic family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    # family: monospace

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Italic

  # Point size
  size: 7.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut
#   - EaseOutSine
#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart
#   - EaseOutQuint
#   - EaseOutExpo
#   - EaseOutCirc
#   - Linear
#
# Specifying a `duration` of `0` will disable the visual bell.

  animation: EaseOutExpo
  duration: 0

# Background opacity
#
# Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.

# Mouse bindings
#
# Available fields:
#   - mouse
#   - action
#   - mods (optional)
#
# Values for `mouse`:

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.

    #
    # This program is executed when clicking on a text which is recognized as a URL.
    # The URL is always added to the command as the last parameter.

    # Default:
    #   - (macOS) open
    #   - (Linux) xdg-open
    #   - (Windows) explorer
    # launcher: xdg-open

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. `/bin/fish`.

#  program: /bin/bash
#  args:
#    - --login

# Windows 10 ConPTY backend (Windows only)
#
# This will enable better color support and may resolve other issues,
# however this API and its implementation is still young and so is
